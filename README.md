# FinTechTransaction Forecast
## Overview
This project aims to forecast financial transaction data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future transaction amounts based on historical data, enabling better financial planning and decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains financial transaction records with information such as transaction amount, date, and category.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset using the exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb notebook. Visualize and analyze key features to gain insights into the data.

## Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data using the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook or by running the data_preprocessing.py script in the src/ directory.

## Model Training
Train machine learning models using historical data. The model_training.ipynb notebook or the model.py script in the src/ directory can be used for this purpose.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained models using the model_evaluation.ipynb notebook. Assess the performance of each model and choose the best-performing one.

## Prediction
Make predictions on future transactions using the prediction.ipynb notebook or the relevant script in the src/ directory.

## Results
Summarize the results obtained from the model predictions and provide insights into the forecasted financial transactions.

## Conclusion
Conclude the findings of the project, discuss potential improvements, and highlight the significance of the forecasting model.
